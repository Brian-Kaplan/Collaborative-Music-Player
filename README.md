#Workflow
---------
When you start to make changes always pull. People will be making changes all of the time so pull as often as you want.
If git yells at you saying you have unstaged changes just type 'git stash'. This will temporarily remove all of your changes so you can pull the changes other people pushed. Once you finished the full type 'git stash apply' and it will reapply the changes. You can now push your changes

When you are making changes please checkout your own branch to push to. Open merge requests on github. This workflow will keep problems to a minimum.
